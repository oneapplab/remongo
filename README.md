REMONGO - Simple and Extendable Repository Pattern with Go and Mongodb.

Using the repository pattern in Go, especially with the Mongodb package (go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver), can help maintain a clean and organized data layer that is easy to extend. The repository pattern abstracts database operations, allowing you to handle CRUD functions and isolate data access from business logic.
